A set of tests intended to be run by https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-unit-tester

Note: Tracks named .base.trk are templates, another script I have reads the payload.lua and will generate payload variants for that template to save time. Follow the guide at https://github.com/Quaggles/dcs-unit-tester/blob/master/README.md#createmissionsfromtemplatesps1
